# Time & Space Complexity

Time complexity refers to the amount of time with relation to the size of the input data, while space complexity refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm as a function of the input size.

## Time Complexity

- O(1) - Constant Time: The execution time remains constant regardless of the input size.
- O(log n) - Logarithmic Time: The execution time grows logarithmically as the input size increases.
- O(n) - Linear Time: The execution time grows linearly with the input size.
- O(n log n) - Linearithmic Time: The execution time grows in proportion to n log n.
- O(n^2) - Quadratic Time: The execution time grows quadratically with the input size.
- O(2^n) - Exponential Time: The execution time doubles with each additional element in the input.
- O(n!) - Factorial
  Time: The execution time grows factorially with the input size.

## Space Complexity

- O(1) - Constant Space: The space required by the algorithm remains constant regardless of the input size.
- O(n) - Linear Space: The space required by the algorithm grows linearly with the input size.
- O(n^2) - Quadratic Space: The space required by the algorithm grows quadratically with the input size.
- O(log n) - Logarithmic Space: The space required by the algorithm grows logarithmically with the input size.
- O(n log n) - Linearithmic Space: The space required by the algorithm grows in proportion to n log n.
- O(2^n) - Exponential Space: The space required by the algorithm doubles with each additional element in the input.
- O(n!) - Factorial Space: The space required by the algorithm grows factorially with the input size.
  Understanding time and space complexity is crucial for evaluating the efficiency of algorithms, especially when dealing with large datasets.

## Big O Notation
- Big O notation is a mathematical representation used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's time or space complexity. It provides a high-level understanding of the algorithm's performance as the input size grows, allowing for comparisons between different algorithms.

- It focuses on the worst-case scenario, helping to identify the most significant factors that affect performance. Common Big O notations include O(1), O(n), O(n^2), O(log n), and O(n log n).
